This Go code demonstrates the use of **channels** and the **`select` statement** for concurrent programming. Here's an explanation of the code, piece by piece:

---

### **Code Breakdown**

1. **Channel Creation**
   ```go
   chan1 := make(chan int)
   chan2 := make(chan string)
   ```
   - Two channels are created:
     - `chan1` is an integer channel (`chan int`).
     - `chan2` is a string channel (`chan string`).

   Channels are used in Go to communicate between goroutines.

---

2. **Goroutines Sending Data**
   ```go
   go func () {
       chan1 <- 10
   }()
   ```
   - A goroutine is started to send the integer `10` into `chan1`.
   - The `chan1 <- 10` operation sends the value `10` to `chan1`.

   ```go
   go func () {
       chan2 <- "ping"
   }()
   ```
   - Another goroutine is started to send the string `"ping"` into `chan2`.
   - The `chan2 <- "ping"` operation sends the value `"ping"` to `chan2`.

   **Note:** These goroutines run independently and concurrently.

---

3. **Receiving Data Using `select`**
   ```go
   for i := 0; i < 2; i++ {
       select {
       case chan1Val := <-chan1:
           fmt.Printf("Message from channel1 %d\n", chan1Val)
       case chan2Val := <-chan2:
           fmt.Printf("Message from channel2 %s\n", chan2Val)
       }
   }
   ```
   - A loop runs **twice** (`i < 2`) to receive messages from the channels.
   - The `select` statement is used to wait on multiple channel operations.
     - If a value is available in `chan1`, the first `case` is executed, and the value is printed.
     - If a value is available in `chan2`, the second `case` is executed, and the value is printed.
     - The `select` ensures that whichever channel receives a message first will have its corresponding `case` executed.

---

### **Purpose of the Code**

1. **Demonstrating Concurrency**:
   - This code demonstrates Go's ability to run multiple independent tasks concurrently using goroutines.
   - Each goroutine sends data to its respective channel.

2. **Channel Communication**:
   - The code shows how to use channels for safe communication between goroutines.

3. **`select` for Multiplexing**:
   - The `select` statement is used to handle multiple channel inputs, ensuring non-blocking behavior.

---

### **What Is This Useful For?**

1. **Concurrent Data Processing**:
   - Useful when multiple tasks need to send data to a central processor (e.g., worker pools).

2. **Event Handling**:
   - Can be used in systems where multiple events need to be handled concurrently.

3. **Coordination Between Goroutines**:
   - Channels are a primary tool in Go for coordinating and sharing data between goroutines.

---

### **Output**
The output may vary based on the order in which goroutines execute. For example:

```
Message from channel1 10
Message from channel2 ping
```
or
```
Message from channel2 ping
Message from channel1 10
```

The order is non-deterministic due to the concurrent nature of goroutines.
